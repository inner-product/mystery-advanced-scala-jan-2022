# ??? Advanced Scala: Day 3

## Scala Strategies

Metacognition

- Algebraic data types
  Logical ands and logical ors
- Structural recursion
  Transforming an algebraic data type
  Recurse when the data is recursion
- Following the types
  Reasoning from the inputs or the outputs

- Interpreters
- Algebras
- Reification
  Implementation technique for interpreters


## Ideas for Next Two Days

Cats stuff
- monoid, semigroup, applicative, monad
- State monad

Performance
- mutation vs copying
- techniques for performant FP systems

Variance

Spark serializability

Debugging implicit resolution problems
- serialization
- SparkSession
- best practices

Eval / executors
- Designing this
- Kafka -> process -> Kafka & Cassandra
- Kafka: Scala wrapper around OSS Kafka client
- Cassandra: DataStax client

Tagless final

Stream of events
- materialize store and executor

Designing APIs for usability, particularly around implicits
